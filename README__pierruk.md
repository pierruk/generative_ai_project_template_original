GitHub does not permit changing the visibility of a forked repository independently; a fork’s visibility is inherently linked to that of its upstream repository. Specifically, all forks of public repositories are public, and you cannot directly make such a fork private.  ￼

However, you can achieve a similar outcome by duplicating the repository and setting it to private. Here’s how:
	1.	Create a Bare Clone of the Original Repository:
This step involves creating a bare clone, which is a copy of the repository without a working directory.

git clone --bare https://github.com/username/original-repo.git


	2.	Mirror-Push to a New Private Repository:
After creating the bare clone, you can push it to a new private repository on GitHub.

cd original-repo.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/your-username/new-private-repo.git


	3.	Remove the Temporary Local Repository:
Once the mirror-push is complete, you can delete the local bare clone repository.

cd ..
rm -rf original-repo.git


	4.	Clone the New Private Repository:
Now, clone the new private repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/new-private-repo.git


	5.	Set Up the Original Repository as a Remote:
To keep your private repository updated with changes from the original repository, add it as a remote.

cd new-private-repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/username/original-repo.git


!!!!! =====================================
	6.	Fetch and Merge Updates from the Original Repository:
Periodically, you can fetch updates from the original repository and merge them into your private repository.

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
!!!!! =====================================



This method allows you to maintain a private version of a public repository while still being able to incorporate upstream changes as needed.
